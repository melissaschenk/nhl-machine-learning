# Final-Project
## NHL Data Set ##
* https://www.kaggle.com/martinellis/nhl-game-data?select=game.csv (Kaggle)
* https://www.quanthockey.com/nhl/team-game-logs/chicago-blackhawks-2016-17-nhl-game-log.html (QuantHockey)
## Time Line ##
* **Saturday 5/1** --> Each add 1-2 possible datasets to file (All)
*  **Monday 5/3** --> Load Data into Database using Amazon AWS, SQL Server (Ben)
* **Monday 5/3** --> Define categories of players and features we are using to categorize them.
* **Monday 5/3** --> Host AWS website with Flask (Ben)
* **Wednesday 5/5** --> K-means clusters for x(time on ice) and multiple Y(Assists, shots, goals, +-, Block Shots). (Andrew)
* **Wednesday 5/7** --> Categorize players based on K-means clusters. (Andrew)
* **Wednesday 5/7** --> Create Bubble graph with similar x and y as K-means (similar to obesity demographic homework)(Melissa)
* **Wednesday 5/7** --> Drop down for players that shows stats. (Romi)
* **Saturday 5/8** --> Build website with bootstrap template (TBD)
* **Wednesday 5/12** --> Have project complete for final run through
* **Saturday 5/15** --> Final Project Due


## Questions to Answer ##
1. Can a players position be determined based on previous time on how successful they are while on the ice, and what theya re successful at?
2. Do players have similarities that can be correlated to a third variable?
3. 

## Training vs Test ##
* Use CSV from Kaggle to train model. Use current Data for this year as Test data to determine what positions players would be most successful in.

## Goal ## 
* Try and predict what position a player should play based on K means clustering of time on ice and other features.  
* https://www.nhl.com/stanley-cup-playoffs


* Website that has multiple tabs.
1. showing predicted model of what players should play what positions using K-Means clustering. User selection to determine what features they want to use in the model
2. Bubble graph with one x(time on ice) and multiple Y(Assists, shots, goals, +-, Block Shots). 
3. Drop down table with player names, that show player stats when chosen...?
