## Questions to Answer ##
1. Can the winner of a game be decided based on the number of takeaways, giveaways, powerplay opportunities, powerplay goals, etc
2. Using clustering, can a model predict the referee(s) of a game based on the number and type of penalties called
3. Can the Stanley Cup teams be decided based on late season momentum? (last 10-20 games). 

## Training vs Test ##
* Use CSV from Kaggle to train model. Use current Data for this year as Test data to determine what next years final teams would be.

## Goal ##
