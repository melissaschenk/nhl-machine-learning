As haiku data on the internet is scarce. To get a sufficient dataset, I have included some of the three-line English poems. This can train our model to have a poetry perspective as well. Haiku are generally of three lines. So the dataset contains only three-line poems only. I have included a source column in the dataset to know which one is an English haiku source or an English poem source.
